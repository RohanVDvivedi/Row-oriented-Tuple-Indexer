Stage 1
 * implement find and insert using the handle interface
 * test find and insert functions
 * implement bplus_tree delete function

Stage 2
 * implement a page_list and a page_cursor interface to read leaf pages list or any page list
   * insert only if tail locked with write, i.e. insert only at the tail
   * read page with seek_page only in one direction
 * use this page_cursor interface to enable range search queries for b+ trees
 * implement support range search and delete queries

STAGE 3
 * implement single page sort (use insert_sorted_packed_page) and then an external_merge_sort for the page_list
 * building a bplus_tree on top if a external_merge_sorted leaf pages (taken as page_list), in multiple runs until there is only 1 page in the tree
