STAGE 1
 * implement page_list_writable_handle api

STAGE 2
 * remove last empty leaf page from the bplus tree, i.e. an empty bplus_tree hoards no page and its handle points to NULL_PAGE_REF
 * implement init deinit both method for bplus_tree and page_list
 * make all tuple definitions part of the handle or the read cursor

STAGE 3
 * perform splits in bplus_tree without a double sized empty page on the stack
 * upon insert/delete perform compaction by checking the efficiency of the page at random (propbability 0.5) if the efficiency drops below 0.7

STAGE 4
 * external_merge_sort for the page_list
 * building a bplus_tree on top of an external_merge_sorted page_list.
 * persistent storage using bufferpool library, providing a simple data_access_methods

STAGE 5
 * set up test source for multi threaded insert delete and search operations
