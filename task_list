 * implement tests utility functions for reading a key, and creating a key tuple using key_def
 * implement macros to pick test keys file for deletion based on the keys for the testdata
 * run a loop, and test all deletions for all key cases

 * implement bplus_tree_cursor
 * implement find

 * implement find test cases to find range of values, add this tests between insert and delete test cases

 * test deletion of non existing keys
 * test inserting records with already existing keys
 * interleave insertions and deletion test cases

 * implement redistribute keys functions for fixed length index_def and record_def tuples, this will reduce propogation of merges, this task can be delayed to be done at the end

 * go through the project and implemnt better error handling for failures of malloc and data_access_methods

 * write multi threaded test cases to catch concurrency bugs in_memory_data_store, like it is done for bufferpool

 * write multi threaded test cases to insert a large csv in to b+tree, measure performance difference

 * provide a way to allow additional default header in the implementation (*future)
